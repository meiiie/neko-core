# Neko Core — Work Log

Running journal of what was done and the decisions behind it. Newest entry first.
Rules that govern this work live in `RULES.md`.

## 2026-06-22 — Session 1: port → harness → go-live

**Ported the coding-agent core out of the frozen `bang_c` (PORTING steps 1–6):**
- config-first (layered overlay + named profiles); providers (`openai_compat` +
  optional `local_llamacpp`) behind one `complete(messages, tools)` contract.
- tool contracts + executable tools: `read_file`/`search` (safe), `write_file`/`bash`
  (gated, approval gate, path-escape refused).
- registries + a real `policy` audit of the safe/gated boundary.
- the agent loop (`complete → tool_calls → observe`, `max_steps` cap); `neko chat`/`run`
  + `--yolo`. 38 pytest tests green.

**Configured the Claude Code harness (full-lean):** `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`
(allow verify-loop, deny edits to `bang_c` + reads of secrets), `.claudeignore`, slash
commands `/verify` `/secret-scan` `/port-module`. (A `neko-explorer` subagent file exists
but per the no-subagent rule we don't use it — kept only as an optional, dormant artifact.)

**Went live:** wired an NVIDIA NIM endpoint via `~/.neko-core/config.json` (key via JSON,
never committed); model `qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct`. Verified end-to-end: the model
called `read_file` and answered correctly.

**Shipped:** merged + pushed to `origin/main`. Installed `neko` via `pipx` (editable);
resolved the name collision with the heritage CLI (heritage stays reachable as `bang-c`).

**Fixed REPL resilience:** survives any turn failure (prints the error, stays at the
prompt), clear API-error messages, EOF / non-TTY diagnostics instead of silent exit.

### Decision — language/runtime: **TypeScript + Bun + Ink** (owner, 2026-06-22)
Evaluated on merits (no sunk-cost; project still small). TS is the proven stack for this
product category (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, opencode all TS+Ink), MCP reference SDK is TS,
Bun compiles to a native binary (drops the Node-runtime dependency), and the team already
ships TS (wiii-desktop). "Offline-first" needs only a local OpenAI-compatible server
(llama-server/Ollama) — no in-process inference, so no Python advantage. Go/Rust are
reserved for LATER if zero-dependency single-binary distribution becomes the main pain
(the Codex/Goose path). The Python build is kept as the spec under `reference/python/`.

## 2026-06-22 — Session 2: TypeScript rewrite (branch `feat/ts-rewrite`)
- Restructured: Python moved to `reference/python/`; TS project at root (Bun, `src/`, `bin/`).
- **TS Step 1 done** — config-first overlay + profiles + env + key-via-env/JSON
  (`src/config.ts`), `openai_compat` provider over `fetch` with retry/backoff + clear error
  parsing (`src/providers.ts`), `doctor`/`init-user`/`init` + the `neko` CLI dispatch
  (`bin/neko.ts`). Typecheck clean; reads the SAME `~/.neko-core/config.json` as Python, so
  the live NVIDIA profile works unchanged; key shows `set`, never the value.

- **Runtime confirmed: Bun + TS + Ink** (owner). Rust reserved for later (Codex path) —
  Ink TUI + MCP Tier-1 are TS-native, Bun already gives single-binary + fast startup.
- Studying the local `claude-code` (claude-js) tree as a **clean-room reference** for
  UX/UI + logic only (never copy). Goal defined in `ROADMAP.md`.
- **A1 done** — tools + registry + policy in TS (`src/tools.ts`, `src/tool-runtime.ts`,
  `src/registry.ts`); `neko tools/agents/commands/capabilities/policy` wired. Tool runtime
  verified (read/search/write/bash, path-escape refused, denial-as-string, safe-under-deny).

### Next (TS) — see ROADMAP.md
- A2 agent loop + `neko run`; A3 real tool set (edit/glob/ls); A4 streaming + cost.
- B1 Ink chat REPL; B2 slash commands; B3 permission modes. C1-C3 project context / resume / MCP.
- D1 tests; D2 single binary + re-point `neko`; D3 rename to Neko Code + merge.

- **A3 done** — coding tool set: `edit` (unique string replace, gated), `glob` (Bun.Glob), `ls` (safe). 7 tools total; coder/explorer agents + policy updated.
- **A4 done** — SSE streaming in the provider (`complete(.., onDelta)`) + token tracking (`src/cost.ts`). `neko run` streams the answer live and prints a token usage line.
- **B1 done** — Ink chat REPL (`src/ui/chat.tsx`): streaming render, interleaved tool lines, inline approval (y/a/n), spinner, one Agent across turns. Deps: ink@7/react@19/ink-text-input/ink-spinner. `neko chat` launches it (lazy import).
