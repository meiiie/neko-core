# Neko Core — Work Log

Running journal of what was done and the decisions behind it. Newest entry first.

## 2026-06-22 — Session 1: port → harness → go-live

**Ported the coding-agent core out of the frozen `bang_c` (PORTING steps 1–6):**
- config-first (layered overlay + named profiles); providers (`openai_compat` +
  optional `local_llamacpp`) behind one `complete(messages, tools)` contract.
- tool contracts + executable tools: `read_file`/`search` (safe), `write_file`/`bash`
  (gated, approval gate, path-escape refused).
- registries + a real `policy` audit of the safe/gated boundary.
- the agent loop (`complete → tool_calls → observe`, `max_steps` cap); `neko chat`/`run`
  + `--yolo`. 38 pytest tests green.

**Configured the Claude Code harness (full-lean):** `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`
(allow verify-loop, deny edits to `bang_c` + reads of secrets), `.claudeignore`, slash
commands `/verify` `/secret-scan` `/port-module`. (A `neko-explorer` subagent file exists
but per the no-subagent rule we don't use it — kept only as an optional, dormant artifact.)

**Went live:** wired an NVIDIA NIM endpoint via `~/.neko-core/config.json` (key via JSON,
never committed); model `qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct`. Verified end-to-end: the model
called `read_file` and answered correctly.

**Shipped:** merged + pushed to `origin/main`. Installed `neko` via `pipx` (editable);
resolved the name collision with the heritage CLI (heritage stays reachable as `bang-c`).

**Fixed REPL resilience:** survives any turn failure (prints the error, stays at the
prompt), clear API-error messages, EOF / non-TTY diagnostics instead of silent exit.

### Open decisions
- **Language / runtime for the product going forward** — Python (current) vs TypeScript
  (Node/Bun) vs Go vs Rust. Evaluated on merits, no sunk-cost (project is still small).
  Recommendation pending owner sign-off (see the session's analysis).

### Next
- Finalize the tech-stack decision.
- Then: nicer REPL (e.g. `prompt_toolkit`) and/or port the MCQ showcase + README refresh.
